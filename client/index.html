    <!-- Make sure to import socket.io script before client, as client needs to use socket! -->
    <!-- This file doesn't actually exist. But remember our const io in our server.
        It's wrapped round the server, so when io detects that our client/web page is 
        requesting socket.io.js, it will send as a string the code of the client side.
        So you don't have to worry about separately downloading client and server parts.

        to change the approach somewhat - but this will work fine for now. -->
